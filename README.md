# ADS

This is a Beckhoff ADS implementation in pure LabVIEW, i.e. using TCP connections.

## Current state
The code was used in a project for production porpuses but not tested under any circumstances. It also has almost none documentation so you should be familiar with ADS terminology.
It should not be used in production. If you would do so please contact me, so I can tell caveats and maybe change to code. Please feel free to adopt the code but commit to this project if you use it.
